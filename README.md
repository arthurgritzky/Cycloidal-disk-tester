# Cycloidal-disk-tester
You can test the feasibility of  various cycloidal disks shapes 

## Description
I 3D-printed model showcasing an 11:1 cycloidal drive, featuring 11 lobes on the disk and 12 pins of the housing.
The disk was generated with the following parameters:

- R = 45 mm (radius of roller pin ring)
- Rr = 5 mm (radius of roller pins)
- N = 12 (number of roller pins)
- E = 3mm (eccentricity of the disk )

The animations and the video show how the disk's lobes engage with the pins. To simplify testing and adjusting the disk parameters, I used a MATLAB file (included), as itâ€™s more straightforward than testing parameters in CAD. So you can use the disk tester to try out various designs and  check out if they work for you.
